<h2>Who Should Go?</h2>
<p>If you're a technology professional or enthusiast in the Waco, TX area, you should definitely come! That includes software developers, web developers, designers, IT support persons, and any other technical trade related to computers, software and hardware. </p>

<h2> Why Should I Go?</h2>
<p>There's a small but growing number of techies in the Waco area. I (<a href="http://derickbailey.lostechies.com">Derick Bailey</a>) am one of them, and I don't know very many of you. I'd like to change that by having a monthly get together over lunch, so that we can talk about technology and Waco. If you're looking to talk tech, make some new friends, and generally have fun with your fellow techies, then you should come. </p>

<h2>When & Where Should I Go?</h2>
<p>The plan is to meet on the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/wacotechlunch%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics">2nd Wednesday of every month</a>, at Rudy's BBQ in Waco.</p>
