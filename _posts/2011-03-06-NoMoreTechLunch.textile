title: "No More Waco Tech Lunch"
---

Due to lack of interest from the community, other community events that happen on a regular basis, and no one showing up, the Waco Tech Lunch is no longer running. Be sure to check out the Waco Social Media Breakfast, though. You'll find plenty of interesting people to talk to and learn more about what is going on in Waco, there.
